Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical data such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, and other health indicators. The model is trained on the popular PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset and evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and mean squared error (MSE).
